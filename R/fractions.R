#' Knowledge spaces on fractions

#' Bases of knowledge spaces on fractions obtained from querying experts.

#' Three experts were queried about prerequisite relationships between 77 items
#' on fractions (Baumunk & Dowling, 1997). A forth basis represents those
#' prerequisite relationships on which the majority of the experts agree
#' (Dowling & Hockemeyer, 1998).
