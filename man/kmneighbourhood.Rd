\title{Compute the neighbourhod of a state within a knowledge structure}
\usage{
kmneighbourhood(state, struct, include = FALSE)
}

\item{state}{Binary vector representing a knowledge state}

\item{struct}{Binary matrix representing a knowledge structure}

\item{include}{Boolean whether the original state should be included
in the result (default FALSE)}

\description{
\code{kmneighbourhood} computes the neighbourhood of a state
within a knowledge structure, i.e. the family of all other
states with a symmetric set difference of 1.
